_Below is a professional bio written about me for an investor prospectus at my previous employer, [Balassanian Enterprises](http://www.balassanianenterprises.com/). It has been redacted to remove confidential information, but it does a decent job of succinctly covering the work I've done in my career preceeding my time at BE. Someday I'll update this to cover my work at BE and beyond..._

## Scott W. Bradley

With almost two decades of experience in software development, architecture, and leadership, CTO Scott W. Bradley brings a unique breadth and depth of expertise to the company’s technical endeavors.

Scott has been at the leading edge of web technology since the early nineties. He was responsible for the University of Washington Health Sciences Center’s first foray into the emerging World Wide Web, building online teaching tools for students, distributed image databases for radiologists and hematologists, drug interaction databases for doctors, and semantic network systems for medical researchers.

After earning a B.S. in Computer Science, with distinction, from the University of Washington, Scott led the development of their next-generation operating system for digital devices at BeComm. He was instrumental in building a revolutionary communications architecture and leading the teams that applied their technologies to solutions ranging from Intel’s web tablet and home audio solutions, to Eclipsys’s handheld clinical assistant devices, to Raytheon’s intelligence-processing defense contracts. He was a key contributor to over a dozen patents filed by the company covering their inventive work.

At Implicit Networks in the mid 2000s, as VP of Engineering, Scott was responsible for the software for handheld media players and set-top boxes commissioned by Intel, AMD, Thomson Multimedia, and D-Link. These solutions implemented ground-breaking technology in the areas of multi-device synchronization, dynamic multimedia transcoding, and mobile user interfaces.

In 2006 Scott led a team at Digbee developing a distributed multimedia synchronization service. This included a cross-platform architecture, fuzzy logic content-matching systems, leading-edge Web 2.0 user interfaces, and a web services platform that presaged “cloud storage”.

Scott co-founded Strings with Edward Balassanian in 2007. As CTO, he oversaw a 10-man software development and Q/A team, managed their offshore engineering team, and ran data center operations for strings.com. As a Chief Architect, his technical vision was critical in building out a highly-scalable, distributed web services architecture.

Scott has been very involved in the open source software community, contributing commits to the Rails core, developing open source jQuery plugins and Ruby gems, blogging about unique solutions, and providing feedback to other open source developers. His keen interest in IaaS and cloud computing has led him to get involved with local meetups such as those hosted by the Seattle Hadoop/Scalability group, Opscode, and the Seattle CTOs Club.

Now with Balassanian Enterprises, Scott is uniquely positioned to lead a lean, pragmatic development team that combines best practices and tried-and-true methodologies with leading-edge technologies to provide the advantage needed to build the next wave of amazing companies.
