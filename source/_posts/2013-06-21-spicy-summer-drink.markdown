Introducing the "Picante Paloma". It's a sweet, spicy, and refreshing drink that's perfect for the first day of summer. This is a mix of a recipe my wife and I found on the internet, a drink we tasted at a friend's wedding called "Late For Work", and our own experimentation. It's more-or-less paleo-friendly, depending on how picky you are about the ingredients.

This recipe makes two drinks (why would you make just one?).

## Required Ingredients

* Fresh raspberries
* Fresh jalapeños
* Organic agave nectar
* Limes (or lime juice)
* Ruby Red Grapefruits (or ruby red grapefruit juice)
* 100% blue agave tequila blanco

## Recipe

I use a stainless steel martini shaker, but you can use a regular cup or pitcher.

#### 1) Put the following ingredients into the shaker:

* 12 fresh raspberries
* 4 slices of fresh jalapeño (I like to chop those slices into quarters)
* 2 tablespoons organic agave nectar
* 2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice

#### 2) Muddle (i.e.: smash it a bunch with a stick).

If you like it spicy like I do, make sure those jalapeños get smashed up and release their juice.

#### 3) Add the following ingredients to the shaker:

* 2 oz of fresh ruby red grapefruit juice
* 4 oz of 100% blue agave tequila blanco
* 6 ice cubes

#### 4) Mix.

Either shake with your shaker, or pour back and forth a few times with another cup.

#### 5) Pour evently into two glasses.

#### 6) Top off each glass with 1 to 1.5 oz of club soda.

#### 7) Go out in the sun and drink it!
