I am starting a new blog here at scottwb.com, and moving away from my old blog [Sleepless Coding](http://sleeplesscoding.blogspot.com/).

There are a few reasons for this:

  * The name "Sleepless Coding" reflects the young, machismo, code-all-night attitude that I used to live by. This is no longer the way I choose to best further all my goals in life. That's a subject for another post, but in short, I have found that I am way more productive when I'm "in the zone". Like any athlete, to be "in the zone", I need to get enough sleep at regular, natural hours.

  * Blogger is terrible. Why is that post-entry box so small? It's as if they still think we all have 640x480 monitors. There are many things I dislike about Blogger. One of which is that it is not well-suited for sharing code.

  * I prefer to be able to have intimate control. I *want* to dig in to the CSS.

  * I want my site to become more than just a blog. Hosting it myself will give me better freedom to do that.

The new blog is still in its early stages, but it will be published soon and I'll start tweaking it incrementally.

All of my old posts can still be seen at my old blog [Sleepless Coding](http://sleeplesscoding.blogspot.com/).
