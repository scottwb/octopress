It seems like more and more in the development community, I'm seeing blog posts titled "I've moved my blog to Github". After hearing so much about the combination of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), I figured I'd give it a look.

The result is what you see here. This is of course still a work-in-progress. I'd like to customize my own theme and style, but the default one provided by Octopress is so nice that I'm perfectly happy to let this sit for a while.

I could go on and on about how great Octopress is, and how I love the workflow based on git and rake, but dozens of others have already done this for me. For example: [http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2011/09/29/blog-moved-to-github-pages/](http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2011/09/29/blog-moved-to-github-pages/)
