It's been almost two weeks since my first [Off The Grid](/blog/2012/02/01/off-the-grid/) post, so I figured I'd report back on how it's been going.

The bottom line is that I really like not being constantly distracted by growl notifications, iPhone push notifications, and little beeps vying for my attention. The biggest issue I had with constant communication connectivity was these concentration-killers. By turning off growl and push notifications, shutting down all social networking apps, and setting pre-defined times to check all these channels, I freed my mind up to focus on being creative for longer spurts.

My biggest concern about this experiment was that I wouldn't be able to resist checking my email, Yammer, Facebook, Twitter, Google Reader, etc. every five minutes for fear of missing something time-sensitive. It turns out that was not the problem for me I thought it would be. {" It seems I'm quite happy ignoring everybody for extended periods of time. "} Knowing that I'll be checking in regularly seems to be enough to relieve any subconscious concern that I'll miss something when I don't have notifications interrupting me.

What about those times someone needs to get ahold of me urgently? I think by not responding immediately to every email, the people around me quickly adjust their expectations. If they need to get ahold of me promptly, they use a more immediate communication channel -- like text messaging.

I think I'll continue in this mode. This seems like a good first step to a personal goal I made for Q1 2012: to be fluidly practicing the art of "zero inbox" by April 1. More on that later...
