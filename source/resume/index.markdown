_I haven't really put together a résumé in 15 years. I've been working as a serial entrepreneur with the same core group of people for a long time. I'm starting the wheels in motion now, but it's actually a bit daunting. Startup years are like dog years. I've done a **lot** in that time. Short of having a real résumé or CV, I've put together a quick brain dump bullet list of the more recent highlights. If and when it becomes important to have a résumé, I'll buckle down and make one for real..._
